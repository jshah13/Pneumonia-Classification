# Pneumonia-Classification
TensorFlow Pneumonia Classification on X-rays

Aim:

In this notebook, we use the chest X-Ray image dataset and leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in order to predict whether an individual has penumonia.

Work Done:

This notebook focuses on how to utilize TPUs efficiently, load in image data, build and train a convolution neural network, finetune and regularize the model, and predict results.

Results:

In our validation set we achieve an accuracy >99%, which only translates to 83% on the testing set, suggesting the model overfit the training data.

Further Steps:

The next step would be to focus on further finetuning of the model to improve performance on the testing dataset.
